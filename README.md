# Commarrite_Quiz

A interactive quiz themed on the denizens of the dark city of Commarragh. This is to fulfil the requirements of  my first independent coding project in my coding journey.

In this project I aim to create a quiz that users can take on either a computer or mobile device. The aim is to have a reactive quiz that can provide a result at the end. Key points to observe is the accessibility of the quiz, device being viewed on as mentioned, and that those with disadvantages can still interact with the quiz.


## Base features
1. A introductory page detailing the nature of the quiz and how to partake in it.
2. Accessibility feature/s for those that need it (including but not limited to alt texts, languages, colour schemes, read-out features for the blind).
3. Questions to be answered adding to the end score on which were correct and which were not.
4. Provide a final score of X/X questions to the user.
5. A "restart" button so the user may start again should they so choose.

### Extra feature to consider
1. Alternative CSS files for the visually impaired. --- this has changed to the user being able to change the font family.
2. specific message based on the score the user scored.
3. maintaing the accessibility state throughout the page.
