# Commarrite_Quiz

A interactive quiz themed on the denizens of the dark city of Commarragh. This is to fulfil the requirements of  my first independent coding project in my coding journey.

In this project I aim to create a quiz that users can take on either a computer or mobile device. The aim is to have a reactive quiz that can provide a result at the end. Key points to observe is the accessibility of the quiz, device being viewed on as mentioned, and that those with disadvantages can still interact with the quiz.


## Base features
1. A introductory page detailing the nature of the quiz and how to partake in it.
2. Accessibility features for those that need it (including but not limited to alt texts, languages, colour schemes, read-out features for the blind).
3. Questions to be answered adding to the end score on which were correct and which were not.
4. Provide a final score of X/X questions to the user.
5. A "reset" button so the user may start again should they so choose.

### Extra features to consider
1. The first question will be fixed in place (given the theme of the quiz), the rest should be random in order each time the app first loads (or resets).
2. Images themed around the question at hand to appear in various "visually cool" ways (sliding from the side, slowly appearing).
3. Auto-scroll down feature once a question is answered and submitted (wether the question was answered correctly or not).
4. Alternative CSS files for the visually impaired.
5. Language selector
